# A-cute-paw
Final project from the SDA 'Python from scratch' course

I've realised this project together with Gaitan Cristina-Elena. We've created a django aplication that allows users to offer for adoption and to adopt different pets.
It has a wide range of features:
  - adoption forms
  - admin site
  - beautifully made templates
  - user authentification
  - blog part, were we can add articles about each species of pets that the user will add
  - swapping owners when the adoption gets approved by the one that offered the pet for adoption
  - filters that allow you to search based on any category
  - a really easy to use favorite pets system that will show on your profile page
  - you can add/update/delete any pet that you offer for adoption
  - in the event the pet get adoptated, he will go inactive and won't be shown on the adoption page anymore
 and many more to come!
 
we've also deployed it on acutepaw.pythonanywhere.com, so take a peak!
